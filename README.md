# SwiftCrashCourse

In this repository, you will find a collection of artifacts crafted during my dedicated journey through the Swift language, as part of my non-obligatory preparation for my internship. <br>
I partly followed the tutorial "Learn the Essentials of Swift" from [Paul Hudson](https://youtu.be/n5X_V81OYnQ?si=BFXe8qQ49MIa09QM). <br>
This repository also acts as data storage and to present the my completed work.
